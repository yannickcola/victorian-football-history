# Victorian Football History
Welcome to the Victorian Football History website!

How it works is you can select any club, and it will then display a chronological history of that club's standings throughout the years.
It will also generate a chart that will visually show you where the club was ranked in the Victorian football pyramid at the time.

I have endless ideas for what I want to achieve here, and am just trying to get started with a good foundation.
Firstly, I need to create a correct and factual database, and make sure everything is displaying properly.
Then, I want to clean up the names of each club to maintain continuity throughout the years, but also maintaining that old name data.

Eventually, I would love to capture information such as coaching staff, captaincy, presidency and general notes for each year's standing.
Even further along, I would love to have individual match data inputted, so that users can easily view the details of their club history.
